I've been working with tech from the moment I enrolled at the University of BrasÃ­lia, back in 2015.

Since my graduation I've been eager to put my skills to the test and improve them. Also, Iâ€™m quite aware that I have a ton to learn and a lot of experience to gain. 

And that is what I most look forward to.
